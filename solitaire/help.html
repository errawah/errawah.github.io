<h1>How to play this game</h1>
<p>
    At the top left corner is a folded deck of cards (say "A"). Next to it is a slot (say "B") where you will see an unfolded card that is moved from slot "A". You can always move cards from slot "A"  by clicking on the last card present in slot "A".  At the right corner are four empty slots for each type of card - "Spade", "Club", "Diamond" and "Heart" which you can identify by their respective symbols. You can drag unfolded card in these respective slots in ascending order. To win this game you should fill all the cards in these 4 slots.
</p><p>
    In the main screen, you will see 7 columns. As you start the game, the folded cards for "A" will fill up these 7 columns. The 1st column will have 1 card, 2nd column will have 2 cards, 3rd column will have 3 cards, 4th column will have 4 cards, 5th column will have 5 cards, 6th column will have 6 cards and the 7th column will have 7 cards. Only the last card of each column is unfolded. You are only allowed to move the last unfolded card from these columns. One card is unfolded from the slot "A" and placed in slot "B". You are also allowed to move this card.
</p><p>
You can only move unfolded cards. Rules for moving unfolded cards are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can only move unfolded cards over the other unfolded cards;</li>
    <li>In the 7 columns you have to arrange the cards in descending order of cards with alternate color;</li> 
    <li>If the unfolded cards in these columns are already in descending sequence you can move the whole sequence in the respective columns;</li>
    <li>If any of the columns are empty and if any of the unfolded cards is "K" then you can move the "K" card in the empty columns if you wish.</li>
</ul>
